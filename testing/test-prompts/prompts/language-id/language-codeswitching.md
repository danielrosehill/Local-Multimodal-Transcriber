# Language and Code-Switching Detection

**Tests:** Language identification, multilingual detection, code-switching patterns, linguistic repertoire

---

Analyze the language(s) used in this recording. Your task extends beyond simple language identification to understanding how and why the speaker navigates between linguistic systems.

Examine:

1. **Primary language identification**:
   - What is the dominant language of the recording?
   - How confident are you in this identification?
   - What phonetic, prosodic, or lexical features confirm this?

2. **Secondary language detection**:
   - Are any other languages or dialects present?
   - Identify specific instances with quoted words/phrases.
   - Are these complete switches or borrowed words/phrases?

3. **Code-switching patterns** (if applicable):
   - Where does switching occur? (sentence boundaries, mid-sentence, single words)
   - What triggers switches? (technical terms, emotional content, quotes, emphasis)
   - Is switching fluent or hesitant?

4. **Accent vs. language interference**:
   - Does the speaker show phonetic influence from another language while speaking the primary language?
   - Distinguish between accent (pronunciation) and code-switching (language change).

5. **Linguistic fluency indicators**:
   - Does the speaker appear equally fluent in all languages used?
   - Which language seems most natural/comfortable?
   - Any search-for-word moments suggesting one language is weaker?

If the recording is monolingual, note that and describe what features confirm native vs. non-native speaker status in that language.
