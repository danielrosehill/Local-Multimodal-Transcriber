# WPM Estimation

**Tests:** Speaking rate calculation, temporal analysis, words-per-minute quantification, pace benchmarking

---

Estimate the words per minute (WPM) speaking rate of this audio recording.

Provide:

1. **Overall WPM estimate**: Calculate or estimate the average speaking rate across the entire recording.

2. **Rate classification**: Categorize the speaking rate:
   - Slow: Below 120 WPM
   - Conversational: 120-150 WPM
   - Moderate: 150-170 WPM
   - Fast: 170-200 WPM
   - Very fast: Above 200 WPM

3. **Variation analysis**: Note if the rate varies significantly throughout:
   - Fastest segment (approximate WPM and when it occurs)
   - Slowest segment (approximate WPM and when it occurs)
   - What might explain the variation

4. **Methodology note**: Briefly explain how you arrived at your estimate (e.g., word count over duration, sampling specific segments).

5. **Confidence level**: Rate your confidence in this estimate (high/medium/low) and note any factors affecting accuracy (audio quality, multiple speakers, significant pauses, etc.)

Reference: Average conversational English is approximately 125-150 WPM. Professional narration typically ranges 150-170 WPM. Auctioneers can exceed 250 WPM.
