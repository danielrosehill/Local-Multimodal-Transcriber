# Speech Pacing and Rhythm Analysis

**Tests:** Temporal speech patterns, hesitation detection, speaking rate variation, fluency assessment

---

Analyze the pacing and rhythm of the speaker's voice in this recording. Focus on the **temporal characteristics** of how they speak, not what they say.

Provide analysis on:

1. **Speaking rate**: Is the speaker talking quickly, slowly, or at a moderate pace? Does the rate change throughout the recording? Identify specific moments where pace shifts occur.

2. **Pauses and hesitations**: Where does the speaker pause? Are these natural breath pauses, thoughtful pauses before important points, or hesitation pauses suggesting uncertainty? Quote the words before and after significant pauses.

3. **Filler usage**: Does the speaker use filler words (um, uh, like, you know)? How frequently? Does this vary by topic or moment in the recording?

4. **Fluency patterns**: Is speech flowing and continuous, or choppy and fragmented? Are there false starts, self-corrections, or interrupted thoughts?

5. **Rhythm consistency**: Does the speaker have a consistent cadence, or does rhythm vary? What might explain the variations?

Based on these observations, what can you infer about the speaker's:
- Familiarity with the topic
- Level of preparation vs. spontaneous speech
- Emotional state or stress level
- Communication style
