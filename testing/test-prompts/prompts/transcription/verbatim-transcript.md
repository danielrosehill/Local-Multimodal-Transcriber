# Verbatim Transcript

**Tests:** Exact speech-to-text accuracy, filler word capture, false start recognition, complete utterance reproduction

---

Transcribe this audio recording exactly as spoken, word for word.

Include absolutely everything:
- All filler words (um, uh, er, ah, like, you know, I mean, etc.)
- False starts and self-corrections
- Repeated words and stutters
- Incomplete sentences and trailing off
- Verbal tics and habitual phrases
- Non-lexical sounds that function as communication (mm-hmm, uh-huh, etc.)

Do NOT:
- Clean up grammar or syntax
- Remove any words or sounds
- Paraphrase or summarize
- Add punctuation that changes meaning
- Correct mispronunciations (transcribe what was said, not what was meant)

Use standard conventions:
- [inaudible] for unclear speech
- [crosstalk] when speakers overlap
- ... for trailing off or significant pauses
- -- for abrupt self-interruptions

The goal is a complete, unedited record of exactly what was spoken.
