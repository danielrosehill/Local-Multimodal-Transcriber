Listen to this audio recording and convert its content into social media posts.

Transform the spoken content into social media format:

1. **Main post**: Create a primary post that captures the key message:
   - Keep it concise (aim for under 280 characters for Twitter/X compatibility)
   - Lead with the hook or most interesting point
   - Use conversational, engaging language
   - Include a call-to-action if appropriate

2. **Thread/carousel version** (if content warrants expansion):
   - Break longer content into numbered posts or slides
   - Each segment should stand alone but flow together
   - First post hooks attention; subsequent posts deliver value

3. **Platform variations** (provide alternatives for):
   - **Twitter/X**: Punchy, concise, hashtag-appropriate
   - **LinkedIn**: Professional angle, industry relevance
   - **Instagram caption**: Visual-friendly, emoji-appropriate, hashtag block

4. **Engagement elements**:
   - Suggest relevant hashtags (3-5 per platform)
   - Include question hooks to drive comments
   - Note any content that would pair well with images/video

Preserve:
- The core message and key insights
- Any quotable phrases or memorable lines
- Specific data points or claims worth highlighting

Adapt:
- Long explanations to punchy statements
- Formal language to platform-native tone
- Complex ideas to accessible, shareable content

The result should be ready to copy-paste into each platform.
