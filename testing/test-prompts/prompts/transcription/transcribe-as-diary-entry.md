# Transcribe as Diary Entry

**Tests:** Format transformation, first-person narrative conversion, emotional capture, personal reflection structure

---

Listen to this audio recording and convert its content into a personal diary or journal entry.

Transform the spoken content into diary format:

1. **Date header**: Include today's date in a diary-appropriate format.

2. **Opening**: Begin with a natural diary opening that sets the context or mood.

3. **Body**: Convert the spoken content into reflective, first-person narrative:
   - Write in intimate, personal tone
   - Include thoughts, feelings, and reactions
   - Capture stream-of-consciousness elements appropriately
   - Allow for tangents and personal asides
   - Include sensory details if mentioned

4. **Reflection elements**:
   - What happened (events, conversations, experiences)
   - How the speaker felt about it
   - Any insights, realizations, or lessons
   - Questions or uncertainties being processed
   - Hopes, worries, or plans for the future

5. **Closing**: End naturally—diary entries don't need formal conclusions.

Preserve:
- The speaker's authentic voice and perspective
- Emotional nuance and intensity
- Personal details and context
- Unresolved thoughts and ambivalence (don't force conclusions)

Adapt:
- Third-person references to first-person ("I")
- Verbal processing to written reflection
- Spoken repetition to natural written emphasis
- Real-time narration to past-tense reflection where appropriate

The result should read as a genuine personal diary entry, capturing the speaker's inner experience.
