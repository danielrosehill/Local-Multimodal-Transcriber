## Meeting Agenda Structure

1. **Header**:
   - Meeting title
   - Date and time (if mentioned, or placeholder)
   - Duration (estimated)
   - Location/dial-in details (placeholder if not specified)
   - Attendees/invitees

2. **Meeting objective**: One clear statement of what the meeting should accomplish.

3. **Agenda items**: For each topic to be discussed:
   - Item number
   - Topic title
   - Brief description (1-2 sentences)
   - Time allocation (estimate based on apparent importance)
   - Discussion leader/presenter (if mentioned)
   - Item type: Discussion / Decision / Information / Brainstorm

4. **Pre-read materials**: List any documents, reports, or information participants should review beforehand.

5. **Preparation requests**: Specific asks for attendees:
   - Data or information to bring
   - Questions to consider
   - Decisions they should be prepared to make

6. **Logistics**:
   - Any special requirements mentioned
   - Equipment or resources needed

Preserve:
- All topics mentioned for discussion
- Stated priorities and must-cover items
- Names of people assigned to lead topics
- Time constraints or deadlines driving the meeting

Adapt:
- Verbal rambling about topics to structured agenda items
- Scattered mentions to logical meeting flow
- Informal topic descriptions to clear, actionable agenda entries

The result should be ready to distribute as a meeting invitation or pre-meeting document.
