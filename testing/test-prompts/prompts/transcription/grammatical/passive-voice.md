# Passive Voice Transcript

**Tests:** Voice transformation, agent demotion, grammatical restructuring, semantic preservation

---

Transcribe this audio recording and convert all active voice statements to passive voice where grammatically possible.

## Transformation Requirements

### Voice Conversion
- "I wrote the report" → "The report was written by me"
- "She completed the task" → "The task was completed by her"
- "We will review the documents" → "The documents will be reviewed by us"

### Guidelines

1. **Agent retention**: Keep the original agent in a "by" phrase unless omission improves readability.

2. **Intransitive verbs**: Some verbs cannot be passivized. Leave these in active voice and note them.

3. **Maintain tense**: The passive version should preserve the original tense.

4. **Clean up**: Remove filler words during transformation.

5. **Readability**: If passive construction creates awkward phrasing, note the original and provide the best possible passive equivalent.

The result should demonstrate how the content would be expressed with focus on actions and objects rather than actors.
