# Past Tense Third Person Transcript

**Tests:** Tense transformation, perspective shift, grammatical consistency, temporal reference handling, narrative voice conversion

---

Transcribe this audio recording and transform it into past tense, third-person narrative.

## Transformation Requirements

### Tense Conversion
- Convert all present tense to past tense
- Convert present progressive ("I am working") to past progressive ("he was working")
- Convert present perfect ("I have done") to past perfect ("he had done")
- Maintain temporal logic and sequence of events

### Person Conversion
- "I" becomes "he/she/they" or "[Speaker Name]"
- "my" becomes "his/her/their"
- "we" becomes "they"
- "me" becomes "him/her/them"
- "myself" becomes "himself/herself/themselves"

### Guidelines

1. **Speaker identification**: If the speaker's name is known, use it. Otherwise, use "the speaker" or a contextual descriptor.

2. **Clean up while converting**: Remove filler words and disfluencies during transformation.

3. **Maintain meaning**: The transformed version must accurately represent what was said and meant.

4. **Reported speech**: Convert appropriately:
   - "I think this is important" → "She thought that was important"
   - "I will do this tomorrow" → "She said she would do that the following day"

5. **Temporal markers**: Adjust time references:
   - "today" → "that day"
   - "tomorrow" → "the next day" / "the following day"
   - "yesterday" → "the day before" / "the previous day"
   - "now" → "then" / "at that moment"

6. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent tense and pronoun usage throughout.

The result should read as a coherent third-person past-tense account of what the speaker communicated.
