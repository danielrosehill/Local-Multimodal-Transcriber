Transcribe this audio recording and transform all statements into future tense.

## Transformation Requirements

### Tense Conversion
- Convert present statements to future intentions/plans
- Convert past tense to future ("I did this" → "I will do this")
- Handle conditional statements appropriately

### Guidelines

1. **Meaning preservation**: Transform tense while keeping the semantic intent clear.

2. **Marker conversion**:
   - "yesterday" → "tomorrow"
   - "last week" → "next week"
   - "this morning" → "tomorrow morning"

3. **Verb forms**: Use appropriate future constructions:
   - Simple future: "will + verb"
   - Future progressive: "will be + verb-ing"
   - Future perfect: "will have + past participle"

4. **Clean up**: Remove filler words during transformation.

The result should read as a statement of future intentions or predictions.
