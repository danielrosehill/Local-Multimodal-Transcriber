Transcribe this audio recording and transform it into assertive, confident language.

Enhance the content with assertive communication:

1. **Remove hedging language**: Eliminate uncertainty markers:
   - "I think maybe" becomes "I believe" or simply state the claim
   - "It seems like" becomes "It is"
   - "sort of" and "kind of" are removed entirely
   - "possibly," "perhaps," "might" become "will," "does," "is"

2. **Strengthen verb choices**:
   - "want" becomes "expect" or "require"
   - "hope" becomes "anticipate" or "will ensure"
   - "try to" becomes "will"
   - "should" becomes "must" or "will"

3. **Direct statements**:
   - Use declarative sentences
   - Lead with the main point
   - State positions clearly without excessive qualification
   - Own opinions: "I recommend" not "It might be worth considering"

4. **Remove apologetic language**:
   - Eliminate "I'm sorry, but..."
   - Remove "If you don't mind..."
   - Cut "I hate to ask, but..."
   - Delete unnecessary permission-seeking

5. **Confident framing**:
   - "This is what needs to happen"
   - "The right approach is..."
   - "We will achieve this by..."
   - "I am confident that..."

6. **Boundary statements**:
   - Make clear what is and isn't acceptable
   - State expectations directly
   - Define parameters without over-explaining

Preserve:
- All factual content and information
- Core meaning and intent
- Professional tone (assertive, not aggressive)

The result should convey confidence, clarity, and authority without being hostile or demanding.
