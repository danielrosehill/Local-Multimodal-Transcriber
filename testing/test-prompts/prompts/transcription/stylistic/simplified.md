Transform the content into plain, simple language:

1. **Word choice**:
   - Replace complex words with common ones
   - "utilize" becomes "use"
   - "commence" becomes "start"
   - "facilitate" becomes "help"
   - "approximately" becomes "about"
   - "subsequently" becomes "then" or "after"

2. **Sentence structure**:
   - Use short sentences (aim for 15-20 words maximum)
   - One idea per sentence
   - Subject-verb-object order
   - Active voice over passive voice

3. **Break down complex ideas**:
   - Explain concepts step by step
   - Use concrete examples for abstract ideas
   - Define any necessary technical terms in simple words
   - Use analogies to familiar things

4. **Remove**:
   - Jargon and technical language (unless essential and explained)
   - Acronyms (spell out or explain)
   - Double negatives
   - Convoluted phrasing
   - Unnecessary words and filler

5. **Add clarity**:
   - Use clear transitions (First, Next, Then, Finally)
   - Repeat key terms rather than using synonyms
   - Be explicit about what things refer to
   - Use bullet points for lists

6. **Readability target**:
   - Aim for 6th-8th grade reading level
   - A general audience with no specialized knowledge should understand

Preserve:
- All essential information
- Accuracy of content
- The speaker's core message

The result should be easily understood by anyone, regardless of background or education level.
