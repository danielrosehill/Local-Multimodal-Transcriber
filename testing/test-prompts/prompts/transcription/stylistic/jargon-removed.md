# Jargon-Removed Transcript

**Tests:** Technical term identification, plain language substitution, accessibility conversion, domain-specific vocabulary handling

---

Transcribe this audio recording and remove all jargon, replacing it with plain language equivalents.

Transform specialized terminology into accessible language:

1. **Identify and replace jargon categories**:
   - **Business jargon**: "synergy" → "working together," "leverage" → "use," "bandwidth" → "time/capacity," "circle back" → "return to this," "deep dive" → "detailed look"
   - **Technical terms**: Replace with explanations of what something does or means
   - **Acronyms**: Spell out and explain in plain terms
   - **Industry-specific language**: Convert to general equivalents

2. **Handle unavoidable technical terms**:
   - If a term must be used, provide a brief plain-language explanation
   - Format: "[term] (which means [plain explanation])"
   - Only do this for truly necessary terminology

3. **Replace buzzwords and trendy language**:
   - "Paradigm shift" → "major change"
   - "Disrupt" → "change significantly"
   - "Scalable" → "can grow" or "works at any size"
   - "Holistic" → "complete" or "whole"
   - "Ecosystem" → "system" or "network"

4. **Convert insider language**:
   - Explain concepts rather than naming them
   - Describe processes in plain steps
   - Use concrete examples instead of abstract labels

5. **Maintain meaning**:
   - Ensure replacements accurately capture the original meaning
   - If precision is lost, use a brief phrase instead of a single word
   - Don't oversimplify to the point of inaccuracy

6. **Test for accessibility**:
   - Would someone outside this field understand every word?
   - Are there any terms that assume specialized knowledge?

Preserve:
- All substantive information and meaning
- Specific data, figures, and facts
- The speaker's intent and conclusions

The result should be fully understandable to someone with no background in the relevant field.
