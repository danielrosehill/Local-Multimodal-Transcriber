**Tests:** Emotional neutralization, affective language removal, objectivity enforcement, clinical tone application

---

Transcribe this audio recording and remove all emotional coloring from the language.

Transform the content to be emotionally neutral and clinical:

1. **Remove intensifiers**: Strip all emphatic modifiers:
   - "absolutely essential" becomes "necessary"
   - "terrible disaster" becomes "negative outcome"
   - "incredibly exciting" becomes "notable"
   - "desperately need" becomes "require"

2. **Neutral vocabulary**: Replace emotionally charged words with neutral equivalents:
   - "amazing" becomes "noteworthy" or "significant"
   - "horrible" becomes "unfavorable" or "suboptimal"
   - "love" becomes "prefer" or "favor"
   - "hate" becomes "disfavor" or "find unsuitable"

3. **Clinical phrasing**:
   - Use passive constructions to remove personal feeling
   - Prefer abstract nouns over vivid verbs
   - State facts without interpretation
   - Avoid value judgments

4. **Remove entirely**:
   - Exclamation points (use periods)
   - Emotional interjections
   - Hyperbole and exaggeration
   - Personal appeals and sentiment
   - Rhetorical questions expressing feeling

5. **Objective framing**:
   - "The speaker indicated..." rather than "The speaker insisted..."
   - "The event occurred..." rather than "The tragedy struck..."
   - "There was disagreement..." rather than "There was a heated argument..."

Preserve:
- All factual information
- Logical structure and arguments
- Specific data and details

The result should read like a technical report, scientific paper, or legal document.
