# Transcript with Filler Words Removed

**Tests:** Selective transcription, filler word identification, maintaining semantic integrity while removing disfluencies

---

Transcribe this audio recording with all filler words and verbal disfluencies removed.

Remove the following:
- Filler words: um, uh, er, ah, like (when used as filler), you know, I mean, basically, actually (when meaningless), sort of, kind of (when hedging)
- False starts and self-corrections (keep only the final intended version)
- Repeated words from stuttering or hesitation
- Trailing "so..." or "and..." that lead nowhere

Preserve:
- All substantive content and meaning
- The speaker's actual word choices (beyond fillers)
- Sentence structure as spoken
- Technical terms and proper nouns exactly as said

Do NOT:
- Rewrite or paraphrase sentences
- Change grammar or syntax
- Add words that weren't spoken
- Correct factual errors or mispronunciations

The result should read more smoothly while remaining faithful to exactly what the speaker meant to say.
