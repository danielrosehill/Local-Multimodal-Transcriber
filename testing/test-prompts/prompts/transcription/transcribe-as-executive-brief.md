## Formatting rules:

1. **Lead with the bottom line**: Executives read top-down; put conclusions first
2. **Quantify where possible**: Use specific numbers, percentages, dates
3. **One page rule**: Keep the core brief to one page; use appendix for details
4. **Action-oriented**: Every brief should make clear what decision or action is needed
5. **Avoid jargon**: Use clear, accessible language

Preserve:
- All data points, metrics, and specific figures
- Names of stakeholders and decision-makers
- Deadlines and time-sensitive information
- Stated recommendations and rationale

Adapt:
- Detailed explanations to concise summaries
- Technical details to business implications
- Exploratory discussion to clear recommendations
- Verbal hedging to confident, clear statements

The result should be ready to present to senior leadership.
