# Third-Person Transcript

**Tests:** Perspective transformation, pronoun conversion, narrative voice adaptation, semantic preservation across viewpoint shift

---

Transcribe this audio recording and convert it to third-person perspective.

Transform all first-person references to third person:
- "I" becomes "he/she/they" or "[Speaker]"
- "my" becomes "his/her/their" or "[Speaker]'s"
- "we" becomes "they" (when referring to speaker's group)
- "me" becomes "him/her/them"

Guidelines:

1. **Speaker identification**: If the speaker's name is known or mentioned, use it. Otherwise, use "the speaker" or a descriptive term based on context (e.g., "the presenter," "the interviewee").

2. **Clean up while converting**: Remove filler words and disfluencies as you transform the perspective.

3. **Maintain meaning**: Ensure the third-person version accurately represents what the speaker said and meant.

4. **Reported speech**: Convert direct statements appropriately:
   - "I think this is important" becomes "She stated that she thinks this is important" or "She expressed that this is important"

5. **Consistency**: Maintain consistent pronoun usage throughout.

The result should read as a clear third-person account of what the speaker communicated.
