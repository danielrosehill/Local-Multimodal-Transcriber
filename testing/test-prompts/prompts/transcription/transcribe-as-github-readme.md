## Formatting rules:

1. **Badges**: Suggest appropriate badges (build status, version, license) if inferable
2. **Code blocks**: Use proper language hints for syntax highlighting
3. **Links**: Use relative links for repo files, absolute for external resources
4. **Images**: Note where screenshots or diagrams would be helpful

Preserve:
- Project name and purpose exactly as described
- All technical requirements and dependencies
- Installation and usage instructions
- API details and parameters

Adapt:
- Verbal project description to concise README sections
- Scattered feature mentions to organized bullet points
- Casual explanations to developer-friendly documentation

The result should be ready to use as a repository README.md.
