Transform the spoken content into formal business email format:

1. **Subject line**: Create a clear, professional subject line that captures the purpose and any urgency.

2. **Greeting**: Use an appropriate professional salutation (Dear [Name], or placeholder if recipient unknown).

3. **Body**: Convert the spoken content into professional business prose:
   - Lead with the main point or request
   - Organize information in logical paragraphs
   - Use formal language and avoid colloquialisms
   - Include relevant context and background concisely
   - Use bullet points for lists of items, requirements, or action items

4. **Action items**: Clearly state any requests, deadlines, or next steps. Be specific about:
   - What action is needed
   - Who is responsible
   - When it is needed by

5. **Closing**: Add a professional sign-off appropriate to the relationship (Regards, Best regards, Sincerely, etc.).

Preserve:
- All substantive information, figures, and data points
- Specific names, dates, deadlines, and deliverables
- The speaker's intent and priorities
- Any commitments or agreements mentioned

Adapt:
- Casual spoken language to formal written tone
- Rambling explanations to concise, structured points
- Verbal hedging to confident, clear statements
- Spoken emphasis to appropriate written formatting

The result should be ready to send in a professional business context.
