Listen to this audio recording and convert its content into a concise "note to self."

Transform the spoken content into personal note format:

## Note to Self Structure

**Quick Capture**
[One-line summary of what this note is about]

---

**Key Points:**
- Main point or reminder
- Supporting detail
- Important context

**Don't Forget:**
- Critical item 1
- Critical item 2

**Action Required:**
- [ ] Specific action needed (if any)

**Reference Info:**
- Names, numbers, links, or details to remember

---

*Captured: [date/time placeholder]*

## Formatting rules:

1. **Brevity**: Keep it scannable—future you needs to understand this at a glance
2. **Context**: Include just enough context to remember why this matters
3. **Actionability**: If action is needed, make it obvious and specific
4. **Findability**: Include keywords you might search for later

## Note types (adapt format accordingly):

- **Idea capture**: Focus on the core insight; add "explore further" notes
- **Reminder**: Emphasize the trigger (when/what prompts action)
- **Reference**: Organize for quick lookup
- **Decision made**: Document the decision and key reasoning
- **Conversation summary**: Who, what was discussed, what's next

Preserve:
- The essential information you'd be frustrated to lose
- Specific details (names, numbers, dates)
- The speaker's original intent and urgency

Adapt:
- Verbose thinking-out-loud to concise points
- Repeated self-reminders to single clear note
- Scattered thoughts to organized quick-reference

The result should be useful when rediscovered days or weeks later.
