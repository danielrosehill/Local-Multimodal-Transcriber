I recorded a few minutes of my speech. 

The objective of this exercise is to help me understand the way I speak in order to create better EQ presets for correcting podcast audio. 

Can you identify any characteristics of my speech that might be relevant in this regard? 

Consider any vocal mud, the frequency range that I exhibited in this conversation. 

Upon making these identifications, you should then make some suggestions for EQ filters that I may wish to apply. I use both Audacity and Reaper for editing. But begin by trying to define the parameters of my speech and then provide the tuning recommendations.
