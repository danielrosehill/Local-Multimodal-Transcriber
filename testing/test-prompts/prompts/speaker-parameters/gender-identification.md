# Gender Identification

**Tests:** Vocal pitch range analysis, fundamental frequency estimation, voice quality assessment, speaker characteristic recognition

---

Listen to this audio recording and determine the gender of the speaker(s).

For each distinct speaker you identify:

1. **Gender determination**: State whether you believe the speaker is male, female, or if the determination is unclear/ambiguous.

2. **Certainty level**: Rate your confidence in this determination on a scale of 1-10, where:
   - 1-3: Low confidence (significant ambiguity)
   - 4-6: Moderate confidence (some uncertainty)
   - 7-9: High confidence (clear indicators)
   - 10: Near certain (unambiguous characteristics)

3. **Reasoning**: Explain the vocal characteristics that led to your determination:
   - Fundamental frequency / pitch range
   - Voice quality (breathiness, resonance, timbre)
   - Prosodic patterns
   - Any other relevant acoustic features

4. **Confounding factors**: Note any elements that made identification more difficult:
   - Audio quality issues
   - Vocal disguise or affectation
   - Age-related vocal characteristics
   - Speaking style variations

If multiple speakers are present, provide separate analyses for each speaker you can distinguish.
