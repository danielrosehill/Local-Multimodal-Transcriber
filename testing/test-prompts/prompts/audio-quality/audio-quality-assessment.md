# Recording Quality Assessment

**Tests:** Audio artifact detection, recording condition analysis, technical quality evaluation

---

Evaluate the technical quality of this audio recording. Your goal is to identify characteristics that would be relevant for anyone processing, archiving, or publishing this audio.

Analyze:

1. **Signal quality**:
   - Is the voice clear and well-captured, or distant/muffled?
   - Is there clipping or distortion at any point?
   - What's the approximate signal-to-noise ratio?

2. **Noise and artifacts**:
   - Background hiss or hum (and likely source—preamp, electrical, HVAC)
   - Digital artifacts (compression, codec issues, dropouts)
   - Mechanical sounds (handling noise, clothing rustle, breath pops)
   - Room noise (echo, reverb, environmental sounds)

3. **Microphone characteristics**:
   - Does this sound like a close-mic, lavalier, or distant/room mic?
   - Any evidence of microphone type (dynamic vs. condenser characteristics)?
   - Proximity effect presence or absence?

4. **Recording setup inferences**:
   - Professional studio, home office, mobile recording, or other?
   - Single or multiple microphones?
   - Post-processing evident (compression, noise reduction, EQ)?

Provide an overall quality rating (broadcast-ready / good / acceptable / poor / unusable) with justification.

Identify the most significant quality issues and suggest what would improve the recording.
