Describe the speaker's pattern of enunciation using phonological terminology. Analyze the following aspects:

- **Vowel production**: Identify any vowel shifts, reductions, or distinctive qualities (e.g., monophthongization, diphthongization, vowel lengthening)
- **Consonant articulation**: Note any consonant variations (e.g., aspiration patterns, voicing, palatalization, lenition, fortition)
- **Rhoticity**: Is the speaker rhotic or non-rhotic? How are post-vocalic /r/ sounds realized?
- **Prosodic features**: Describe intonation patterns, stress placement, and rhythm (stress-timed vs. syllable-timed)
- **Connected speech phenomena**: Note any assimilation, elision, liaison, or other coarticulatory effects
- **Phonotactic patterns**: Any distinctive syllable structures or consonant clusters

Use IPA notation where helpful. Provide specific examples from the audio to illustrate each observation.
