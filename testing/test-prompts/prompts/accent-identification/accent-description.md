Describe the speaker's accent in detail. Consider the following:

- What regional or national variety does the accent suggest?
- Are there any distinctive phonetic features (e.g., rhoticity, vowel shifts, consonant pronunciations)?
- Does the accent suggest the speaker is a native or non-native speaker of the language?
- If non-native, what might be the speaker's first language based on their accent patterns?
- Are there any sociolinguistic markers (e.g., urban vs. rural, formal vs. informal register)?

Provide specific examples from the audio to support your observations.
