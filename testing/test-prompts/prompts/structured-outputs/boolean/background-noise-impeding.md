# Background Noise Impeding Transcription

**Tests:** Audio quality assessment, noise detection, transcription feasibility evaluation

**Response type:** Boolean (Yes/No)

---

Does this audio message contain significant background noise that impedes accurate transcription?

Respond with only: **Yes** or **No**

Answer **Yes** if:
- Background noise makes portions of speech unintelligible
- Environmental sounds (traffic, crowds, machinery, wind) obscure the speaker's words
- Audio quality issues prevent reliable transcription of significant content
- You would need to mark multiple sections as [inaudible] in a transcription
- The signal-to-noise ratio makes it difficult to distinguish speech from background

Answer **No** if:
- Background noise is present but speech remains clearly intelligible
- Minor ambient sounds do not interfere with understanding the speaker
- Audio quality is sufficient for accurate transcription
- Any background noise is incidental and does not obscure meaning
- The recording is clear enough to transcribe with high confidence
