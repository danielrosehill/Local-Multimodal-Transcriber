# Voice Demographics and Characteristics

**Tests:** Age estimation, gender perception, physical characteristic inference, speaker profiling

---

Based solely on vocal characteristics, provide your analysis of the speaker's demographic profile. Be clear that these are inferences based on acoustic patterns, not certainties.

Analyze:

1. **Approximate age range**:
   - What age bracket does the voice suggest? (child, teen, young adult, middle-aged, elderly)
   - What specific vocal characteristics inform this estimate? (pitch range, vocal fry patterns, articulation clarity, vibrato characteristics)
   - Provide a range rather than a specific number.

2. **Vocal characteristics suggesting physical traits**:
   - Fundamental frequency range (typically correlates with vocal tract size)
   - Resonance characteristics
   - Breathiness, clarity, or other quality markers

3. **Language background indicators**:
   - Native speaker patterns or L2 indicators?
   - Any phonetic patterns suggesting multilingual background?
   - Distinct from accent—focus on linguistic fluency markers.

4. **Professional/habitual voice use**:
   - Does the voice suggest someone who speaks professionally? (trained voice, broadcast patterns)
   - Any indication of occupational voice use? (teaching, sales, performance)
   - Vocal health indicators (strain, nodule patterns, overuse)

5. **Confidence and caveats**:
   - Which inferences are you most/least confident about?
   - What would you need to hear to increase confidence?
   - What alternative interpretations exist?

Note: Frame all responses as probabilistic observations, not definitive claims. Vocal characteristics vary widely within demographic groups.
