# Conversation Turn-Taking Dynamics

**Tests:** Interruption patterns, conversational flow, speaker dominance, collaborative vs. competitive dialogue

---

This recording contains a conversation between multiple speakers. Analyze the turn-taking dynamics—how speakers share (or compete for) the conversational floor.

Examine:

1. **Turn transitions**:
   - How do speakers signal they're finished? (falling intonation, trailing off, explicit handoff)
   - How do speakers signal they want to speak? (sharp intake of breath, false starts, verbal cues)
   - Are transitions smooth or abrupt?

2. **Interruption patterns**:
   - Who interrupts whom? Is it balanced or asymmetric?
   - Are interruptions competitive (talking over) or collaborative (finishing thoughts, supporting)?
   - Quote specific instances of interruptions and describe how they sound.

3. **Silence and overlaps**:
   - How long are pauses between speakers?
   - Are there moments of overlapping speech? How are they resolved?
   - Are silences comfortable or awkward? How can you tell?

4. **Dominance indicators**:
   - Speaking time distribution—who talks more?
   - Who introduces topics vs. who responds?
   - Whose interruptions succeed vs. get yielded to?

5. **Conversational style**:
   - Is this a formal exchange, casual chat, interview, debate, or other format?
   - Is the dynamic cooperative, hierarchical, or adversarial?

Provide a summary characterizing the relationship dynamic suggested by these patterns.
