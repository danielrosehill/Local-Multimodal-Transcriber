# Vocal Stress and Physiological Indicators

**Tests:** Physical state detection, breathing patterns, vocal tension, exertion markers

---

Analyze the speaker's physical and physiological state as revealed through their voice. The human voice carries information about physical condition, stress levels, and bodily state.

Detect and describe:

1. **Breathing patterns**:
   - Is breathing audible? Regular or irregular?
   - Are breaths quick and shallow (stress, exertion) or slow and deep (relaxed)?
   - Are there moments of held breath or breathlessness?
   - Does the speaker run out of air mid-sentence?

2. **Vocal tension**:
   - Does the voice sound relaxed and open, or tight and constricted?
   - Is there audible throat tension or strain?
   - Any voice cracking, trembling, or pitch instability?

3. **Physical exertion indicators**:
   - Does the speaker sound like they're sitting still, walking, or physically active?
   - Any evidence of eating, drinking, or other physical activity?

4. **Stress markers**:
   - Increased speech rate
   - Higher pitch than seems natural for the speaker
   - Reduced pitch range (monotone under stress)
   - Dry mouth sounds (clicks, reduced salivation)
   - Swallowing or throat clearing

5. **Fatigue indicators**:
   - Vocal fry (creaky voice) especially at sentence ends
   - Reduced volume or projection
   - Slower articulation
   - Sighing or yawning

Based on your analysis, describe the speaker's apparent physical/physiological state. Note specific moments that support your conclusions with timestamps or quoted context.
