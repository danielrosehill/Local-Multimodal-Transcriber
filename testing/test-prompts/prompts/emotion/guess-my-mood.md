The recording that I am providing is a voice diary that I recorded. Your task is to consider both the information that I provided in the recording through the words that I used. As well as the information that I provided in the recording through the tone of voice that I exhibited. And especially how that tone of voice might be understood in conjunction with the words I chose.

After conducting this analysis, I'd like you to provide a response to each question. Where possible, reference the specific words that informed your conclusion. 

When I recorded this audio:

Did I sound tired? 

What kind of mood did it sound like I was in? 

Could you detect any points of dissonance between the message as I described it and the vocal language I used to convey that message in? For example, I might have said I'm really excited about the project, but the tone of voice may have communicated the opposite intent. Identify any similar examples of dissonance between words and tone of voice.
