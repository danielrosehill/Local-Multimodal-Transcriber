# Speaker Confidence Analysis

**Tests:** Vocal certainty indicators, authority projection, hesitation patterns, conviction detection

---

Analyze the level of confidence the speaker exhibits throughout this recording. Confidence is expressed through multiple vocal dimensions—your task is to identify and interpret these signals.

Evaluate:

1. **Vocal certainty markers**:
   - Statement finality: Do sentences end with downward intonation (certainty) or upward (questioning/seeking validation)?
   - Volume consistency: Is the speaker's volume steady, or does it drop at the ends of statements?
   - Pace: Are statements delivered at a consistent pace, or do they slow/speed at uncertain moments?

2. **Hedging language** (both words AND delivery):
   - Words like "maybe," "I think," "sort of," "kind of," "I guess"—how are these delivered? With genuine uncertainty or as habitual speech patterns?
   - Are qualifiers spoken quickly (as throwaways) or emphasized?

3. **Topic-based variation**:
   - Does confidence level change depending on what's being discussed?
   - Identify the moments of highest and lowest apparent confidence, quoting the relevant speech.

4. **Authority signals**:
   - Declarative vs. tentative phrasing in delivery
   - Self-correction patterns (confident speakers often don't backtrack)
   - Filler word frequency and placement

Provide a confidence profile:
- Overall confidence level (1-10)
- Specific high-confidence moments (with quotes)
- Specific low-confidence moments (with quotes)
- What topics or statements seem most/least certain
