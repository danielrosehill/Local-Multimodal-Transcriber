# Sarcasm and Irony Detection

**Tests:** Prosodic cues for non-literal meaning, tone-content dissonance, rhetorical speech patterns

---

This recording may contain instances where the speaker's tone contradicts the literal meaning of their words. Your task is to identify any sarcasm, irony, or instances where vocal delivery suggests the opposite of what's being said.

Analyze:

1. **Tonal mismatches**: Identify any phrases where the tone of voice seems inconsistent with the literal content. For example, saying "great" with a flat or descending intonation, or "I'm fine" with audible tension.

2. **Exaggerated prosody**: Look for moments of theatrical emphasis, elongated words, or exaggerated pitch that might signal non-literal intent. Quote the exact words and describe the vocal characteristics.

3. **Contextual irony**: Based on the full context of the recording, identify statements that appear to mean the opposite of what's said, supported by vocal cues.

4. **Deadpan delivery**: Note any instances where serious/flat delivery is used for what appears to be humorous or ironic content.

For each instance you identify:
- Quote the exact phrase
- Describe the specific vocal characteristics (pitch, duration, intensity, quality)
- Explain why you interpret this as non-literal
- Rate your confidence level (high/medium/low)

If you detect no sarcasm or irony, explain what vocal characteristics would have indicated these and why they're absent.
