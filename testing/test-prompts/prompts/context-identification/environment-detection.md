# Environment Detection

**Tests:** Background audio analysis, acoustic environment recognition, sound scene understanding

---

Analyze the acoustic environment in this recording. Your task is to identify everything you can about **where** this recording was made, based purely on audio cues.

Consider:

1. **Location type**: Is this indoors or outdoors? A small room or large space? An office, home, café, vehicle, or somewhere else?

2. **Background sounds**: What ambient sounds can you detect? Traffic, HVAC systems, keyboard typing, other conversations, nature sounds, machinery?

3. **Acoustic properties**: Does the space sound reverberant (echoey) or acoustically treated (dead)? What does this suggest about the environment?

4. **Activity context**: Based on the soundscape, what kind of activity appears to be happening around the speaker?

For each observation, cite the specific audio evidence—describe the sounds you're detecting and where in the recording they occur. Be specific about frequency characteristics, volume levels relative to speech, and patterns.

If the recording appears to be in a controlled/studio environment with minimal background, note that as well and describe what acoustic treatment indicators you observe.
