The audio file provided contains a discussion between two or more individuals. Verbal communication consists both the words and information contained in the tone of voice. We can also consider pauses between speech to be forms of nonverbal communication. All of this data is accessible through your understanding of the audio contained in the prompt. 

The male voice in the audio is Daniel and the female voice is Hannah. 

Your task is to act as an expert in interpersonal communication. To support your observations, you must consider both the words that were spoken by each party as well as the non-verbal clues that you could observe - such as the tone of voice in which they were delivered and how that added context to the raw meaning of the words. 

To support every conclusion, you must reference the exact words, verbatim, as they were spoken.

Provide 3 observations about the discussion.
