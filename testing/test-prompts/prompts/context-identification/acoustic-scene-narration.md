# Complete Acoustic Scene Narration

**Tests:** Holistic audio understanding, temporal sound event detection, narrative audio description

---

Provide a complete narrative description of everything happening in this audio recording, as if describing it for someone who cannot hear it. This is the most comprehensive test of audio understanding—go beyond transcription to describe the full acoustic scene.

Your narration should cover:

1. **Sound events timeline**:
   - Describe sounds in the order they occur
   - Include non-speech sounds (doors, typing, coughs, background events)
   - Note when sounds appear, change, or disappear

2. **Speaker activity**:
   - Not just what's said, but how (whispered, shouted, laughed while speaking)
   - Physical sounds (chair movement, walking, handling objects)
   - Paralinguistic sounds (sighs, hmms, laughter, throat clearing)

3. **Environmental audio**:
   - Constant background (HVAC, traffic, nature)
   - Transient events (phone rings, notifications, doors)
   - Spatial characteristics (reverb changes, distance variations)

4. **Audio quality events**:
   - Any recording artifacts, dropouts, or quality changes
   - Microphone handling or position changes
   - Volume or quality shifts

5. **Temporal structure**:
   - Natural segments or chapters in the audio
   - Pacing and rhythm of the overall recording
   - Beginning, development, and conclusion of the audio content

Write this as a flowing narrative, not a bullet list. Imagine you're providing audio description for accessibility—complete, precise, and evocative.
