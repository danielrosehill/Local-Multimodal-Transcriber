### Guidelines

1. **Hierarchy**: Use indentation to show relationships between points
2. **Completeness**: Capture all substantive content
3. **Brevity**: Each bullet should be one line where possible
4. **Logical grouping**: Organize by topic, not chronologically
5. **No editorializing**: Report what was said, not your opinion

The result should serve as comprehensive notes for someone who couldn't listen to the recording.
