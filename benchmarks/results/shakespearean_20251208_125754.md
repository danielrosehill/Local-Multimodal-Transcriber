# Shakespearean Transcript

**Tests:** Archaic language transformation, Early Modern English application, iambic sensibility, theatrical style adaptation

---

Transcribe this audio recording and render it in the style of Shakespearean English.

Transform the content into Early Modern English as used by Shakespeare:

1. **Pronoun transformations**:
   - "you" (singular/informal) → "thou" (subject), "thee" (object), "thy/thine" (possessive)
   - "you" (plural/formal) → "you," "ye"
   - "your" → "thy" or "your" (based on formality)
   - "yourself" → "thyself"

2. **Verb conjugations**:
   - Second person singular: add "-st" or "-est" ("thou speakest," "thou dost," "thou hast")
   - Third person singular: often "-eth" ("he speaketh," "it moveth")
   - Use "doth" for "does," "hath" for "has"

3. **Vocabulary substitutions**:
   - "yes" → "aye" or "yea"
   - "no" → "nay"
   - "very" → "most," "passing," or "exceeding"
   - "before" → "ere"
   - "quickly" → "anon," "forthwith," "presently"
   - "perhaps" → "perchance," "mayhap"
   - "must" → "needs must"
   - "nothing" → "naught"

4. **Characteristic phrases**:
   - "Hark!" for attention
   - "Marry!" as an exclamation
   - "Prithee" for "please" or "I pray you"
   - "Forsooth" for "in truth"
   - "Wherefore" for "why"
   - "Methinks" for "I think"

5. **Stylistic elements**:
   - Invert word order for effect ("Know you not...?" "Well speak they who...")
   - Use "O" for vocative ("O noble friend")
   - Add rhetorical flourishes and apostrophes
   - Include occasional rhyming couplets if natural

Preserve:
- All substantive content and meaning
- The speaker's intent and message
- Key information and facts

The result should sound authentically Elizabethan while remaining comprehensible.

## Response

**Thou hast created a number of speech-to-text prototypes in the past year, and I feel that multimodal audio is the way forward. Instead of providing an audio file to a speech-to-text model, and then providing that transcription to a large language model for cleanup, it is much easier to upload something to a multimodal model that hath audio understanding as a key component.**

**I shall provide context data for what I am attempting to achieve in this repository, and explain the idea, and provide a sort of roadmap for the plan here.**
